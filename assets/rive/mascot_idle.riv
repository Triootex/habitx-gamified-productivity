# This is a placeholder for the Rive mascot idle animation
# In a real project, this would be a binary .riv file created in Rive Editor
# The file would contain:
# - A cute mascot character in idle state
# - Blinking eyes animation
# - Subtle breathing motion
# - State machine with idle, happy, excited states
